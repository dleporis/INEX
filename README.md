P1-project Aalborg University

Autonomous exploration of the area with mobile Turtlebot2. Our team used ROS and C++ source code.
The robot is remote-controlled via SSH connection and was sending a 3D map and pictures back to the user.
We also tried detecting objects within a specific colour range with OpenCV.
